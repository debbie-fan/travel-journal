        description: "Visited on a nice and sunny day. The Queen wasn't at the palace, so we didn't get to see her but I really enjoyed walking around the parks near the palace and seeing the soldiers! The parks in England are very nice with lots of big trees and a lot of people enjoy bringing blankets and hanging out on the open green spaces. Fun fact: this photo I took and edited has been viewed over 2 million times on Unsplash and downloaded over 1000 times! It's been used in articles about the Buckingham palace and a few hotel and trip websites."

Fun fact: It was founded in 1209, making it the world's third-oldest surviving university. Bloop, thanks for making it this far!"

        description: 'Went on a shuttle bus to Stonehenge, it was crazy to see the huge stones in person. Very mysterious and interesting to walk around the area, there were some structures and other historical information throughout the area. How did the stones get there?! There were a lot of theries. Wish we got to see it during sunset, maybe next time! Fun fact: 2.13m of Stone 56, the tallest standing stone on the site, is buried underground - in total it measures 8.71 metres from base to tip.'
